# A-Look-Into-Space-Launches-around-the-World
## Introduction
This is the final project for my Data Analytics Certificate. I found the dataset on space launches in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sefercanapaydn/mission-launches/). It includes space launches worldwide from October of 1957 (the Sputnik) through August of 2020. This was a fun data set to work with, specially for a space nerd like myself. The data required thorough cleaning before importing it into MySQL workbench and begin querying. The data log is saved on a file in the repository along with 
## Hypothesis:
While the USA consistently maintains the highest number of launches since 1959, they also maintain the highest failed launch percentage.
## Questions for hypothesis:
</br>
- What are the top 5 countries with the highest number of launches (excluding the USA)?
</br>
Russia, Kazakhstan, France, China, and Japan.
</br></br>
- What is the percentage of failed launches for the USA and the next 5 countries from question No. 1?
+ USA Failed/Total Launches= 163/1,349= 12.08%
+ Russia Failed/Total Launches= 93/1,398= 6.65%
+ Kazakhstan Failed/Total Launches= 93/701= 0.1326= 13.27%
+ France	Failed/Total Launches= 18/303= 0.0594= 5.94%
+ China Failed/Total Launches= 25/269= 0.0965= 9.29%
+ Japan Failed/Total Launches= 13/126= 0.1092= 10.31%
</br>
USA has the second highest rate of failed launches. Kazakhstan has the highest rate.
</br></br>
- Which is the country with the lowest percentage of failed launches?
</br>
France
</br></br>
- Comparing the USA launches to these 5 countries, do they have a lower percentage of failed launches or relatively the same?
</br>
Only Japan and Kazakhstan have percentage higher than 10, but the other 3 are below. France, Russia, and China have the lowest percentages and as such are more successful in their launches.
</br></br>
- Is there a correlation between the month of the launch and a successful or failed launch?
</br>
The most successful and failed launches are in June or December. This seems to be because most launches are held in those two months.
</br></br>
- What was the costliest failed launch and which country was it?
</br>
The most expensive failed launch cost $450M in 1986, The Challenger.
